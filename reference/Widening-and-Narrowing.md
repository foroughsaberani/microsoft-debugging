# Widening and Narrowing in Typescript

This document covers the following concepts:

1. Widening: treat an internal type as a normal one.
2. Literal widening: treat a literal type as a primitive one.
3. Narrowing: remove constituents from a union type.
4. Instanceof narrowing: treat a type as a subclass.
5. Apparent type: treat a non-object type as an object type.

## Widening

Widening is the simplest operation. The types `null` and `undefined`
are converted to `any`. This happens recursively in object types,
union types, and array types (including tuples), but only when
`--strictNullChecks` is off. With `--strictNullChecks` on, widening no
longer happens.


Before `--strictNullChecks` existed, the compiler already had
internal-only types for `null` and `undefined`. But these types
needed to be converted to `any` whenever they became external, such as
when they were displayed in an editor. That's still what happens
when `--strictNullChecks` is off. For example:

```ts
// @strict: false
let x = null;
```

Here, `null` has the type `null`, even with `--strictNullChecks` off,
but `x` has the type `any`. The compiler widens on assignment.
`undefined` works the same way.

## Literal widening

Literal widening is significantly more complex than "classic"
widening. Basically, when literal widening happens, a literal type
like `"foo"` or `SomeEnum.Member` gets treated as its base type:
`string` or `SomeEnum`, respectively. The places where literals widen,
however, cause the behaviour to be hard to understand. Literal
widening is described fully
[at the literal widening PR](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/10676)
and
[its followup](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/11126).

### Fresh literal types and mutable locations

There are two key points to understand about literal widening.

1. Literal widening only happens to literal types that originate from
expressions, not types. These are called *fresh* literal types.

For example, the literal `1` has the fresh literal type `1`. But a `1`
in a type annotation is not a fresh literal type.

2. Literal widening happens whenever a fresh literal type reaches a
*mutable* location.

One example of a mutable location is a `let` variable declaration. In
contrast, a `const` variable declaration is not a mutable location.
Compare the following two statements:

```ts
const one = 1; // 'one' has type: 1
let num = 1;   // 'num' has type: number
```

For the first statement:

1. `1` is an expression, so it has the fresh literal type `1`.
2. `1: 1` is assigned to `const one`, which is not mutable, so `one: 1`.
   But the type `1` is still fresh, which will be important later.

Meanwhile, for the second statement:

1. `1` is an expression, so it has the fresh literal type `1`.
2. `1: 1` is assigned to `let num`, a mutable location, so `num: number`.

Mutable locations and fresh literal types interact in confusing ways.
For example:

```ts
const one = 1;
let n = one; // 'n' has type: number
```

The first two steps are the same as the first, `const` example.

1. `1` is an expression, so it has the fresh literal type `1`.
2. `1: 1` is assigned to `const one`, so `one: 1`.
3. `one: 1` is assigned to `n`, a mutable location, so `n: number`.

The fresh literal type `1` makes its way *through* the assignment to
`one` down to the assignment to `n`, and, since it's still fresh,
widens to `number`. This is confusing, but it is the way a real
program is supposed to work. A program defines constants at the top,
then uses those constants as the initial values for variables:

```ts
const start = 1001;
const max = 100000;
// many (thousands?) of lines later ...
for (let i = start; i < max; i = i + 1) {
  // did I just write a for loop?
  // is this a C program?
}
```

The type of `i` must be number; if it were `1001` then it could only
over have the value `1001` and the statement `i = i + 1` would be illegal.

Other mutable locations are elements of array literals and object
literals:

```ts
const nums = [1, 2, 3]; // 'nums' has type: number[]
nums[0] = 101; // because Javascript arrays are always mutable
```

`nums` has type `number[]` because `1`, `2`, and `3` individually have
the matching literal types `1`, `2`, and `3`, but each array element
widens the fresh literal type to `number`.

In addition, mutable locations become non-mutable locations if
they are in a const context, which is produced by an `as const` type
assertion on the containing expression.

```
const doom = { e: 1, m: 1 } // 'doom' has type: { e: number, m: number }
doom.e = 2

const doom2 = { e: 1, m: 1 } as const // 'doom2' has type: { e: 1, m: 1 }
doom2.e = 2 // error, '2' is not assignable to '1'
```

### Literal type widening relationships.

Literal types widen to their respective supertype. Specifically:

* Number literal types like `1` widen to `number`.
* String literal types like `'hi'` widen to `string`.
* Boolean literal types like `true` widen to `boolean`.
* Enum members widen to their containing enum.

An example of the last is:

```ts
enum State {
  Start,
  Expression,
  Term,
  End
}
const start = State.Start;
let state = start;
let ch = '';
while (ch = nextChar()) {
  switch (state) {
    // ... imagine your favourite tokeniser here
  }
}
```

## Narrowing

Narrowing is the removal of types from a union. Control flow starts
from the *declared type* of a variable and maintains a *computed type*
that narrows as control flow encounters predicates and other uses that
prove facts about the type.

The declared type of a variable is the one it's declared with. For
`let x: number | undefined`, that's `number | undefined`. The computed
type of a variable is the type of the variable as it's used in
context. Here's an example:

```ts
// @strict: true
type Thing = { name: 'one' | 'two' };
function process(origin: Thing, extra?: Thing | undefined): void {
  preprocess(origin, extra);
  if (extra) {
    console.log(extra.name);
    if (extra.name === 'one') {
      // ...
```

`extra`'s declared type is `Thing | undefined`, since it's an optional
parameter. However, its computed type varies based on context. On the
first line, in `preprocess(origin, extra)`, its computed type is still
`Thing | undefined`. However, when control flow encounters the
`if (extra)` check, it knows that `extra`'s computed type is just
`Thing` inside the block. The check proves that `undefined` can't be
part of the type since `undefined` is falsy.
`Thing | undefined` has *narrowed* to `Thing`.

Similarly, the declared type of `extra.name` is `'one' | 'two'`, but
inside the true branch of `if (extra.name === 'one')`, its computed
type is just `'one'`.

Narrowing mostly commonly removes all but one type from a union, but
doesn't necessarily need to:

```ts
function f(thing: string | number | boolean | object) {
  if (typeof thing === 'string' || typeof thing === 'number') {
    return lookup[thing];
  }
  else if (typeof thing === 'boolean' && thing) {
    return globalCachedThing;
  }
  else {
    return thing;
  }
}
```

Here, in the first if-block, `thing` narrows to `string | number` because
the check allows it to be either string or number.

## Instanceof Narrowing

`instanceof` narrowing looks similar to normal narrowing, and
behaves similarly, but its rules are somewhat different. It only
applies to certain `instanceof` checks and type predicates.

Here's a use of `instanceof` that follows the normal narrowing rules:

```ts
class C { c: any }
function f(x: C | string) {
  if (x instanceof C) {
    // x is C here
  }
  else {
    // x is string here
  }
}
```

So far this follows the normal narrowing rules. But `instanceof`
applies to subclasses too:

```ts
class D extends C { d: any }
function f(x: C) {
  if (x instanceof D) {
    // x is D here
  }
  else {
    // x is still just C here
  }
}
```

Unlike normal narrowing, `instanceof` narrowing doesn't remove any
types to get `x`'s computed type. Instead, it and changes the computed
type to `D` inside the `if (x instanceof D)` block when `D` appears to
be a subclass of `C`. Also unlike normal narrowing, in the `else`
block, `x` is still `C`.

`instanceof` narrowing doesn't produce errors; if the checked class is
not a subclass of the declared type, the compiler does its best
to make sense of things:

```ts
class E { e: any } // doesn't extend C!
function f(x: C) {
  if (x instanceof E) {
    // x is C & E here
  }
  else {
    // x is still just C here
  }
}
```

The compiler thinks that something of type `C` can't also be
`instanceof E`, but just in case, it sets the computed type of `x` to
`C & E`, so that all the properties of `E` are at least available.
This can be confusing to Typescript authors, since it's reasonable to
expect an error for code that the compiler believes can never execute.

### Type predicates

Type predicates follow the same rules as `instanceof` when narrowing,
and are just as subject to misuse. So this example is equivalent to
the previous incorrect one:

```ts
function isE(e: any): e is E {
  return e.e;
}
function f(x: C) {
  if (isE(x)) {
    // x is C & E here
  }
  else {
    // x is still just C here
  }
}
```

## Apparent Type

An *apparent type* of a type always has properties, even when the
original type does not. One example is primitives:

```ts
let n = 12
let s = n.toFixed()
```

The type `number` is a primitive in Typescript and has no properties;
`Number` does. Apparent types provide the mapping from `number` to
`Number`. Whenever the compiler needs to get properties of some type,
it asks for the apparent type of that type first.
The other types that have interesting apparent types are type parameters:

```ts
interface Node {
  parent: Node;
  pos: number;
  kind: number;
}
function setParent<T extends Node>(node: T, parent: Node): T {
  node.parent = parent;
  return node;
}
```

`T` is a type parameter, which is just a placeholder. But its
constraint is `Node`, so when the compiler checks `node.parent`, it
gets the apparent type of `T`, which is `Node`. Then it sees that
`Node` has a `parent` property.

The following types have interesting apparent types:

* `number` and number literals &rarr; `Number`
* `string` and string literals &rarr; `String`
* `boolean` and `true` and `false` &rarr; `Boolean`
* `symbol` and unique symbol &rarr; `Symbol`
* `bigint` &rarr; `Bigint`
* `object` &rarr; `{}`
* type parameters &rarr; the base constraint of the type parameter
* `keyof` types &rarr; `string | number | symbol`
